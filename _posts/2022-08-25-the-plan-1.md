This is post two in a development diary I am writing on setting up a new homelab
in my home office.  In the last post I discussed the reasons why I decided
to go with the homelab route as opposed to some far simpler routes to handle
my current needs.  This time I wanted to discuss the steps I believe I need to
take to meet my initial goal:

A containerized database server for my larger (> 10 GB) development databases in
a homelab environment.

## Step 1:  The development diary
I wanted to ensure that I was recording my reasoning and process for the system
as I went along through the process.  Therefore, you are reading the product of
step 1 of my process - the development diary site.  At the moment, I am hosting
this in Github, but I may mirror this locally in my homelab at a point in the 
near future.

## Step 2:  The virtualization server
The core of any homelab seems to be a virtualization server, at least initially.
This server should be able to host both full virtual machines (essentially a part
of a computer that is walled off and treated as if it was running on its own
hardware) and containers (lean virtual machines that run a pared down version of
a full VM).

A better description of a virtual machine can be found at 
[VM Ware](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-machine.html).  
This company has been in the business for a very long time and, in my 
professional experience knows what they are talking about.  However, I can't 
afford the VMWare software for my home computer.

The big player in the container space is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
that is what I plan on using.

As for a homelab virtualization server, it seems that [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/)
is the current choice for most homelab builders right now.  Specifically,
the community version of Proxmox VE is what is used right now.

## Step 3:  A container host
There is just one major issue with Proxmox - it does not support Docker
containers.  Instead, they use LXC (pronounced Lex Cee) for thier containers
which limits the options somewhat.  So, I need a VM hosting a container server.
There seem to be two options here:
- [Rancher](https://rancher.com/)
- [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)
For my use, it seems that I should use Portainer for now.  However, that is the 
advantage of a homelab - if you don't like one thing, try another.

## Step 4:  A control center
Since setting up a service to contain links to all my services is not difficult
once the container host is setup, that is what I plan on doing next.  My thought
is to stick with the community favorite:  [Heimdall](https://heimdall.site/).

## Step 5:  The database server
At this point, I can setup the actual database server as a container.  The one trick
is allocating enough resources to the server (specifically disk space and memory)
to handle the larger databases I have to deal with.

## Future steps
- DNS:  Despite having Heimdall setup, I would still like to be able to reference my services by name.  This _may_ help.
- PiHole:  Getting my network setup through PiHole might be useful.  It is certainly a favorite to prevent unwanted tracking and ads
- Project tracking:  Either through Azure DevOps or through something like Trello
