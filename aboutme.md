subtitle: Who I am and why I am doing this
---

My name is Jake Walter and I am a Civil Engineer with a specialty
in software development.  This site is the starting page for a homelab
that I am currently building.  The idea is to provide a
diary of my objectives, reasoning, and plans for the system I am
setting up at home.  This will help me track why I did things and,
hopefully, not keep repeating the same mistakes.  It is also helping
me to learn Jekyll, a static site generator created by Github.

# Civil Engineer
My main title at work is Civil Engineer.  I help public agencies figure
out how to allocate funding to maintenance project, optimize their
maintenance processes, design asset evaluation programs, and manage
the large amount of data that is used as the basis of many multi-million
dollar budgets.

## What makes you so civil?
I've heard this joke before.

## What does a Civil Engineer do?
Engineering is split into a number of different major disciplines but
it can be divided into four major areas:
- Macro engineering:  Things you can see and touch - roads and machines
- Micro engineering:  Things you can't see but know exist - electricity
- Chemical engineering:  Using chemistry to achieve some goal - making gasoline, for example
- System engineering:  Working with processes and things that do not result in physical products

Macro engineering can be roughly divided up into two parts:
- Mechanical engineering: Things that are supposed to move (cars, machines, airplanes)
- Civil engineering:  Things that are supposed to remain still (roads, bridges, pipelines)

Of course, each major discipline has a bunch of specialties.  For civil
engineers this includes structural, geotechnical, and environmental
engineering.

## What is **your** specialty?
I am a transportation engineer.  That is, I deal with the infrastructure
that gets you from your home to work, school, or commercial area.  I also
deal with companies that move cargo using roads, rail, and air.  My typical
client is a public works agency or state department of transportation.  

Of course this isn't terribly specific.  Transportation covers a lot of
topics.  My specialty within transportation is **infrastructure asset management**.
I help agencies with limited money determine where to spend their money 
because they never have enough to address all their needs.

# Software Developer
How do I achieve these goals?  An infrastructure asset management project
is usually a very data driven field.  We collect data from our clients
and supplement that data with our own through field testing and the use
of public datasets.  What does that require?  Software, IT skills, and
data analysis skills.

To meet my project requirements, I have spent the last 25 years focused
on software development to further my engineering work.  This includes
both doing the development work myself and working with a team (either
as another developer or a project manager/product owner) to meet project
goals.

## What tools do you use?
It depends on the client, but I have been working in the Microsoft
ecosystem for a very long time with the exception of a quick 2 year
foray into Linux.  This means that these days, while I am comfortable
with C and C++, I am primarily a .NET developer.  Specific tools I use
day to day include:

- VB.NET (I have been using VB since 3.0)
- C# (I switched to C# several years ago and only do VB when required)
- ASP.NET MVC for web development.  I have used it just for backend work and for frontend development as required
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript

As for development practices, I use Object Oriented Development and 
Unit Testing as two of my basic development approaches.  I try and 
use Test Driven Development as well when I can.

For team projects, we are currently using Azure DevOps.

## What else can you do in the software world?
I like to think of myself as a generalist.  Often, I am making minor
revisions to existing software when I implement a system for a specific
client.  This means I have to be able to do things in cloud services
(I do a lot of work in Azure) or I have to maintain and install software
on internal client machines.

Also, I mentioned earlier that infrastructure asset management is a data
driven field.  This means quite a bit of data analysis work.  I have to
have decent skills in the database realm including SQL Server administration
and data queries.  This includes standard SQL queries, the use of Excel
for basic analysis, and the use of LINQ in C# for more advanced work.
I know a little Python as well, but I tend to use LINQ as I am more
comfortable with it.
